 ####  a lightweight script built with late night developers in mind




 ## Full Version Can Be Found <a href="https://github.com/alexanderepstein/Sandman">here</a>

 Sandman will remind you to take a rest and that you can always come back to the work tomorrow.

A sleep cycle is a 90-minute chunk of time where your body transitions through various phases of sleep — all the way down to deep REM sleep — then back again. Some health experts believe that these 90-minute sleep cycles are the key to restful sleep. They recommend trying to sleep exactly 7.5 hours — or even 9 hours, if you have the time.

Based on the time you need to wake up — and assuming it will take you 15 minutes to fall asleep — Sandman will notify you throughout the evening at specific times when you could go to sleep and maximize your number of full sleep cycles.

# Helping Out
##### Feel free to fork this repository add some code and submit a pull request

### List of yet to be implemented features
* Parse the -g option to be more human readable
* Add option to show parsed times in 24 or 12 hour formatting
* No uptime notification
* No error exiting

## Bugs

* All ```at``` jobs are removed
 when sandman-lite removes the old notification jobs by just removing all jobs. If you regularly schedule jobs through '''at''' this application will cancel those jobs.

     Solution: Determine what the job id is of the notification as i set it so it can be specifically referenced for later deletion

* Uninstaller script doesn't uninstall the dependencies if they weren't their before installation of sandman-lite
